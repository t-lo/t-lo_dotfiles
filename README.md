Purpose
-------
t-lo's configuration files & co. Currently only my vim config and add-ons.


Installation
------------

* You need git installed on your system in order for the install script
  to work.
* Download `install-dotfiles.sh` to your home directory
  `$ cd`
  `$ wget https://raw.github.com/t-lo/t-lo_dotfiles/master/install-dotfiles.sh`
* run the installer script
  `./install-dotfiles.sh`

From here on you can simply use git for managing the dotfiles (e.g. you could
branch, fork, and add your own upstream repo).
